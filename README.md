# Advent of Code 2015
Following along with http://adventofcode.com!

Starting out by doing everything in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), but may also try out other languages as well. In particular, [pony](http://www.ponylang.org) sounds fun :D

## Solutions
No actual solutions will be committed to this repo. Only the programs written to compute the solutions and their inputs will be available here.

## Leaderboard
I didn't hear about this until day 10, so I didn't start until then. Here are my leaderboard stats from all the days after that:

| Day | Place (out of 100 listed) | Completion time |
|---|---|---|
| 11 | #58 | 00:17:06 |
| 12 | #59 | 00:17:29 |
| 13 | N/A | ~00:30:00 |
| 14 | #68 | 00:22:00 |
